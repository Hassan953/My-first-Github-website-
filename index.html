    <h2 class=heading>How To Put A Video On Your Website</h2>
    <h2 id=link><strong>Step 1</strong></h2>
<p id="heading2">The first step is you have to send the video from your phone to your computer. </p>
    <h2 id=link>Step 2</h2>
    <p id="heading2">To encode the video open "Adobe Media Encoder". From there you will need to change some things about your video like, </p>
    <li id="heading2">Change size to 720 x 480 </li>
    <li id="heading2">speed to 30 frames per sec </li>
    <li id="heading2">Aspect - Square Pixels </li>
    <li id="heading2">Profile - Baseline </li>
    <li id="heading2">Level 3.0 </li>
    <li id="heading2">Bitrate encoding: VBR 2 pass </li>
    <li id="heading2">Target Bitrate - 1.5 </li>
    <li id="heading2">Max Bitrate 1.8 </li>
    <li id="heading2">Use Max Render </li>
    <p  class="title"> you will also need to change your audio to:</p>
    <li  id="heading2">AAC </li>
    <li id="heading2">Sample Rate 44100 </li>
    <li id="heading2">Mono </li>
    <li id="heading2">Bitrate - 80 </li>
    <h2 class="heading"> Before and after i encoded my video</h2>
    <p id="heading2">Before i encoded my video the size of it was 54.3 MB and after it was 5.26 MB. The quality is almost exactly the same witch was kind of surprising.</p>
<video width="720" height="480" controls>
  <source src="Assets/Video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="Assets/Video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
    <h2 class="heading">How To Use Brackets</h2>
    <p id="heading2">Brackets are what tell your computer what to do. They are the most important things when making a website.<br> Learning brackets is basically learning a new language, different brackets do different things. Some of the brackets i know how to use are, heading brackets, paragraph brackets, paragraph dividing brackets, style brackets etc. <br> when you are writing a website you first put the name of the bracket you want to use, for example if i wanted a heading i put h1 inside of brackets and then /h1 inside brackets after it. the number you put is how big the text will be. if you want to divide a paragraph you put a br in brackets but for this one you dont need an end tag.
        <h2 class=heading>How To Add Screen Shots</h2>
    <h2 id=link> Step 1</h2>
    <p id="heading2">Adding screenshots is similiar to adding a video, first you open a snipping tool on your computer and crop what you want to screenshot, then you save it to your assets folder (the same one used for the video) and then you put in an image tag and place your photo. You can copy and paste an image tag from <strong id="title"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">here</a></strong><br> I am going to add a photo of how the tag looks like down below. Once you paste the tag inside your work delete the "smiley.gif" and replace it by typing the name of the the file name of your picture.</p>
    <img src="Assets/screen%20shot%201.PNG" alt="Smiley face" width="60%">
    <p class=title> You are going to have to change the size to "width=(what ever you want)%"</p>
    <div id="heading2"> The end </div>
